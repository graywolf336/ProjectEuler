My Answers to Project Euler Problems
===

This is mostly my collection of answers to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. I will be attempting them in both JavaScript (es6) and also in Java, which one comes first depends on the complexity of the problem.

My quest to continue improving my math and computer science skills.

Think I can improve an answer or you see an issue with my answer? Please do create an issue about it so we can discuss, I would love to have some discussions! :heart:
